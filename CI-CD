Devops=Devops is a software development approach which involves continous development, continous testing, continous integration, continous deployment and continous monitoring through out its development life cycle.

                                                        Continous Monitoring           
Unit testing: It is the process of testing each part of code how its work
Integration testing :It is process of how all the parts of code working together
Pipeline: It is the logical or sereas of steps which define how SDLC accures.                                                   
CI: As soon as developers commits the code into the version control system it conntinously merging the process and continously building the process simontaniously that is the reson it is know as continous integration.                            
Jenkins: Jenkins is an open source tool written in java with plugins built for continous integration purpose, plugins allows integration of various devops stages.
